README

I created this application, GameAnalyticsJsonParser, for a friend of mine who is an economics professor.  He is looking to perform statistical analysis on consumer behavior and transactions for a specific app.  The company provided him with hourly data in gzipped JSON form.  The app I created for him unzips the files, deserializes the JSON, aggregates each hourly file into daily files and outputs it in either csv or Excel format, which he uses as input to his statistical analysis software.

Please respond with any questions, comments, suggestions.
